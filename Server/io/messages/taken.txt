I don't know who you are.
I don't know what you want.
If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money.
But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career.
Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it.
I will not look for you, I will not pursue you.
But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.

Taken, and this scene particularly has become a meme at this point.
Nonetheless, I still think it is a strong action film that sheds light on a global issue that is not often present in mainstream films.
After a father has his daughter kidnapped by a group of human traffickers, the former government operative, played by Liam Neeson, goes on a war path to find and save his daughter.
The end result is an impressive action-packed film filled with Neeson going full, vengeful father and rescuing his daughter.
The scene above, when first heard in theatres, was badass and chilling, with most viewers impressed with Neeson's character portrayal.

It's probably one of the most famous movie monologues by an Irish actor.
