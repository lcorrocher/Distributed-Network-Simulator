                   THE BATMAN SCRIPT (LONG VERSION)

             EXT. HIMALAYAN FORTIFIED MONASTERY -- DAY 18

    Wayne climbs up the steps to the VAST DOORS of the
   monastery. Unwraps a severely FROSTBITTEN FIST. POUNDS
  against the icecovered wood, knocks ECHOING deep within.
    Nothing. Wayne lowers his forehead to the door, shoulders
    wracked by SOBS, pounding accelerating to a FRENZY.
             A GRINDING noise from within. Wayne STOPS, straightens. The
                       doors SWING OPEN to DARKNESS...

               19 INT. GREAT HALL, MONASTERY -- CONTINUOUS 19

       Wayne shuffles forward into a low-ceilinged wooden hall lit
           by flickering lamps. Hands trembling, Wayne pulls at brittle
               scarves. He STARTS as the doors THUD shut behind him.
            At the far end, on a raised platform, sits a dark robbed
                    figure; RA’S AL GHUL. Wayne moves unsteadily towards him...

                    Ra’s Al Ghul?
    ARMED WARRIORS of various races emerge from the SHADOWS:
       BOWS taut, SWORDS drawn... NINJAS. Wayne freezes.
                DUCARD (O.S.)
                        Wait.
   The Warriors hold. Wayne looks at the source of the command:
                  Ducard leans against a nearby pillar.
        Wayne reaches into his layers of clothing. Pulls out the
                   DOUBLE-BLOOMED BLUE POPPY. Holds it out, shaking.
            Ra’s Al Ghul starts to speak in Urdu. Ducard TRANSLATES.
                         DUCARD
            Fear has been your guide. But now
             you must advance or fear will keep
            you on your knees. We will help you
          conquer your fear. In exchange you
         will renounce the cities of man.
           You will live in solitude. You will
          be a member of the Leagues of
       Shadows. And you will be without
                      fear.
        Ducard takes the flower. Considers its delicate blue petals.
                      DUCARD (CONT’D)
                  Are you ready to begin?
    Ducard threads the flower through the buttonhole of his
                   lapel. Wayne looks at Ducard, shaking with hunger and
                                 fatigue.
                    WAYNE

              Death does not wait for you to be
                             ready...
                    Wayne crawls, gasping. Ducard STRIKES him in the ribs.
                       DUCARD (CONT’D)
              Death is not considerate, or fair.
                   And make no mistake- today, death
                     is your opponent.

  Ducard turns- WHIPS his leg in a fearsome roundhouse KICK
                 aimed straight at Wayne’s NECK-
   -but Wayne BLOCKS the kick with a lateral movement of his
             forearm. He stares at Ducard, eyes BLAZING. Ducard SMILES.

          towards the central station at the base of Wayne Tower.
                      23 INT. CONCOURSE, WAYNE STATION -- MOMENTS LATER 23
      Young Bruce STARES at the MAGNIFICENT STATION. He looks up
        through the vaulted glass ceiling... WAYNE TOWER rises
                   above... Rich ORCHESTRAL STRINGS rise, and we are
                    24 INT. GOTHAM OPERA HOUSE -- LATER 24
    A gilded house packed to the rafters for Boito’s Mefistofle.
   Young Bruce seated between his parents, On stage: WITCHLIKE
          CREATURES cavort. DARK BIRDS on wires descend, FLAPPING.
      Young Bruce STARES, uneasy, at their VIOLENT motions.
            INSERT CUT: BATS EXPLODE FROM A DARK CREVICE.
     Young Bruce starts breathing faster, STARES fixedly.
    (CONTINUED)
                CONTINUED: (2) 13.
 SCREECHING, FLAPPING BLACK BATS SWARM ALL AROUND...
     Young Bruce, gulping PANIC breaths, looks around for an
       exit- they’re in the middle of a row. He GRABS his Dad’s
                                arm.
                            YOUNG BRUCE
                       (desperate whisper)
                              Can we go?!
      Thomas stares at his son, confused. Martha looks over. Young
      Bruce looks at his father, PLEADING. Thomas nods. They make
                     their way along the row, Thomas nodding apologies...
                      25 EXT. SIDE ALLEY, GOTHAM OPERA HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 25
     The Waynes emerge from a side exit. Martha crouches before
      Bruce, tries to meet his eyes. He stares down, ashamed.
                            MARTHA
                     Bruce, what’s wrong?
                           THOMAS
                             He’s fine.
      Martha looks up. Thomas gives her a conspiratorial look.
                        THOMAS (CONT’D)
                   I just needed a bit of air. Bit of
                 opera goes a long way, right,
                               Bruce?
     Young Bruce looks up at his Dad, who winks. Young Bruce
                               smiles gratefully.
                        THOMAS (CONT’D)
                              Come one.
      Thomas, coat over his arm, ushers his family down the dark
      alley, heading for the WELCOMING GLOW of the main boulevard.
           A FIGURE emerges from the shadows in front of them. A MAN.
                       With a GUN. Shifting uneasily.
                             MAN
                           Wallet, jewelry! Fast!
                            THOMAS
                            (calm tone)
                      That’s fine, just take it easy.
    (CONTINUED)
               CONTINUED: (2) 14.
         Thomas hands Young Bruce his coat, then reaches for his
                    wallet. The Man JERKS the gun at Thomas, eyes DARTING. Young
                      Bruce stares up at the gun TREMBLING in the Man’s hand.
                            THOMAS (CONT’D)
                             Here you go.
        The man GRABS at the wallet but FUMBLES it. It FALLS. The
        Man glances down at the wallet then back to Thomas, scared.
                            THOMAS (CONT’D)
                         (reassuring tone)
                              It’s fine, it’s fine...
           The Man crouches for the wallet, eyes on Thomas.
                            THOMAS (CONT’D)
                      ...just take it and go.
           The Man feels for the wallet, looks at Martha. Her pearls.
                              MAN
                          I said jewelry!!
               She starts pulling off her rings. The Man JERKS the gun at
                                    her neck. Thomas STEPS protectively in front of his wife.
                             THOMAS
                                Hey, justBOOM. Young Bruce FLINCHES. Thomas looks down at his
                          bleeding chest. Then back to the Man, saddened.
                             Thomas CRUMPLES. Martha SCREAMS. The Man REACHES for
                            Martha’s pearls- but she SCREAMS desperately for Thomas.
                               MARTHA
                           THOMAS!! THOMAS!!
                               MAN
                              Gimme the damn...
        But Martha FLAILS, trying to grab her fallen husband.
        The Man SHOOTS her. Then YANKS at her necklace, which
        BREAKS. Spilling PEARLS all over the asphalt.
        The Man stands. Turns to Young Bruce. Who STARES at him.
        Uncomprehending. The Man cannot bear the boy’s gaze...
        And then he RUNS. Young Bruce looks at the bodies of his
        parents. DROPS to his knees, head down: PEARLS dot the
        asphalt beneath him. Some of them are bloody.


                                   15.
         Young Bruce starts to SHIVER.
   26 INT. POLICE STATION -- NIGHT 26
   CHAOS: REPORTERS and COPS vying for a piece of the crime of
   the decade. In the Captain’s office, Young Bruce.
   Bewildered, forgotten. Still clutching his father’s
   overcoat.
            MALE VOICE (O.S.)
             Is that your father’s?
   Young Bruce looks up: a young beat cop stands over him- JIM
   GORDON (29). Gordon crouches, reaches for the coat. Young
   Bruce huddles over it, protective.
                       GORDON
                             (reassuring)
                                It’s okay.
   Gordon’s tone prompts Young Bruce to trust him. Gordon takes
   the coat, DRAPES it gently across Young Bruce’s shoulders.
            MALE VOICE (O.S.)
   GORDON! You gotta stick your nose
   into everything!
   Gordon turns to CAPTAIN LOEB, who glares at him.
              CAPTAIN LOEB
                       Outta my sight.
   Gordon NODS at Young Bruce, whose eyes wish Gordon would
   stay. Gordon leaves. Loeb turns to Young Bruce.
             CAPTAIN LOEB (CONT’D)
                   Good news... we got him, son.
   Young Bruce looks up at him dazed. Uncertain.
   27 EXT. GROUNDS, WAYNE MANOR -- DAY 27
   Snow falls over two open graves. MOURNERS disperse, guided
   by SECURITY GUARDS. Alfred stands with Young Bruce. A man
   approaches, EARLE (47). He nods at Alfred, crouching.
                            EARLE
                         (indicates Alfred)
               You’re in excellent hands, Bruce.
     And we’re minding the empire. When
   you’re all grown up, it’ll be
                        waiting.
   Young Bruce looks blankly at Earle.
   28 EXT. WAYNE MANOR -- LATER 28
   Mourners file towards the gates. Rachel walks with her
   mother. Looks up at Bruce’s high window. Sees him watching.
                               Waves. Young Bruce pauses, then returns the wave.
   29 INT. BRUCE’S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS 29
   Alfred enters. Looks tenderly at Young Bruce’s back.
                    ALFRED
               I thought I’d prepare a little
                                supper.
      No response. Alfred turns.
                    ALFRED (CONT’D)
                               Very well.
                YOUNG BRUCE (O.S.)
                              Alfred?
   Alfred turns back. Young Bruce is looking at him with TEARS
   POURING down his cheeks. Alfred tilts his head.
                    ALFRED
                           (voice catching)
                         Master Bruce?
            YOUNG BRUCE
           It was my fault, Alfred.
                Alfred’s mouth opens.
           YOUNG BRUCE (CONT’D)
   I made them leave the theaterALFRED
                    Oh, no, no, noAlfred moves to Young Bruce, taking the boy in his arms.
           YOUNG BRUCE
        If I hadn’t got scaredALFRED
    No, no, Master Bruce. Nothing you
     did. Nothing anyone ever did can
                excuse that man.
   (CONTINUED)
   CONTINUED: (2)                   17.
    Alfred holds Young Bruce away to look directly into his
                      eyes.
                   ALFRED (CONT’D)
        It’s his, and his alone. Do you
                     understand?
         Young Bruce nods. Then BURIES his face in Alfred’s chest,
                                sobbing.
           YOUNG BRUCE
         I miss them, Alfred. I miss them so
                                    much.
                ALFRED
                           (whispering)
                So do I, Master Bruce. So do I.
    Tears well in Alfred’s eyes as he HOLDS the boy, watching
              snowflakes swirl past the window.
                        DUCARD (V.O.)
            And do you still feel responsible?
    30 INT. PASSAGEWAY, MONASTERY -- DAY 30
    Ducard leads Wayne along a screened passage overlooking
                     extraordinary mountains.
                     WAYNE
         My anger outweighs my guilt.
                  Ducard opens a door...
            31 INT. DOJO, MONASTERY -- DAY 31
         Leads Wayne onto a MEZZANINE LEVEL stacked with boxes and
                 bottles. NINJAS pour powders into packets, mixing compounds.
                Ducard takes a pinch of a powder- throws it down- BANG!
          Wayne FLINCHES- Ducard SMILES good-naturedly.
                         DUCARD
               Advanced techniques of Ninjitsu
                employ explosive powders.
                             WAYNE
                                 As weapons?
                         DUCARD
        Or distractions. Theatricality and
              deception are powerful agents.
   (CONTINUED)
   CONTINUED: (2)                   18.
             Ducard hands Wayne a pinch of the powder.
                          DUCARD (CONT’D)
           To be a great warrior is not
         enough. Flesh and blood, however
                 skilled, can be destroyed... you
               must be more than just a man in the
                          minds of your opponents.
                  Wayne listens to this. Tosses the powder- BANG!
    32 EXT. FROZEN LAKE, HIMALAYAS -- DAY 32
         Wayne and Ducard CIRCLE each other on the ICE, SWORDS poised
               to strike. Dark figures in the white and blue landscape.
        Ducard STRIKES at Wayne, who DEFLECTS the blow using a
     SILVER GAUNTLET with THREE SCALLOPS (thick, hook-like
            projections). Ducard SKIDS left, breath STEAMING, feinting
                             with his sword.
          Wayne steps sideways on the ice, his foot landing on a thin
          patch which CREAKS, water BUBBLING underneath.
                        DUCARD
               Mind your surrounding. Always.
              Wayne STRIKES- Ducard BLOCKS with his own BRONZE GAUNTLET.
                 Wayne SLIPS right and FLIES IN with a short THRUST- Ducard’s
     arm flips down in a backhand moveDucard CATCHES Wayne’s sword in one of his SCALLOPS.
                          DUCARD (CONT’D)
                Your parent’s death was not your
                                fault...
       Ducard ROTATES his arm, WRENCHING Wayne’s sword from his
                         grasp- it SKIDS along the ice.
                          DUCARD (CONT’D)
                ...it was your father’s.
             Wayne, ENRAGES, dives at Ducard, SWINGING at him with the
               scallops, FURIOUS, RECKLESS. Ducard parries with his sword,
             they LOCK- noses inches apart, Wayne BREATHING... ANGRY...
                           DUCARD (CONT’D)
         Anger does not change the fact that
                     your father failed to act.
                      WAYNE
                   The man had a gun!
                          DUCARD
                      Would that stop you?
                            WAYNE
                          I’ve had trainingDUCARD
               The training is nothing. The will
          to take control is everything. Your
                 father trusted his city, its
            logic... he thought he understood
      the attacker and could simply give
                him what he wanted...
       Wayne considers this... breathing slowing... CALMER... they
                                  separate.
                         DUCARD (CONT’D)
                             (gently)
      Your father did not understand the
               forces of decay- cities like Gotham
      are in their death throes- chaotic,
                                   grotesque. Beyond saving.
                            WAYNE
                     Beyond saving? You believe that?
        Ducard regards the harshly beautiful landscape.
                            DUCARD
             It is not right that one must come
               so far to see the world as it is
                                meant to be. Purity. Serenity...
                                   Solitude. These are the qualities
                            we hold dear. But the important
                      thing is whether you believe it...
                            Wayne stares at Ducard.
                          DUCARD (CONT’D)
             Can Gotham can be saved, or is she
            an ailing ancestor whose time has
                                             run?
         Ducard STRIKES DOWN at Wayne with his sword. Wayne BLOCKS
         the strike with FOREARMS CROSSED, SLIDES BETWEEN DUCARD’S
              LEGS across the ice to where his sword lies.
        GRASPING his sword he SPINS, SWEEPING at Ducard’s feet.
            Ducard LEAPS- Wayne CATCHES his foot, brings him down onto
                           the ice. Wayne THRUSTS his sword at Ducard’s throat-
   (CONTINUED)
   CONTINUED: (3)                   20.
            STOPS INCHES from Ducard’s bare neck. Ducard freezes, arms
                            at his sides. Wayne looks down at Ducard, SMILING in
                                      triumph.
                           WAYNE
                                   Yield.
                   Ducard smiles. Shakes his head.
                            DUCARD
            You haven’t beaten me. You’ve
              sacrificed sure footing for a
                                 killing stroke.
           Ducard TAPS the ice beneath Wayne’s feet with his sword- the
                     ice gives way, PLUNGING Wayne through the surface.
     33 EXT. SHORE, FROZEN LAKE -- EVENING 33
         Ducard feeds a small FIRE. Wayne RUBS his arms, SHIVERING
                   violently against hypothermia. Ducard looks at him.
                          DUCARD
             Don’t rub your arms, rub your
             chest. Your arms’ll take care of
                                 themselves.
         Wayne rubs his torso, NODS at Ducard. Ducard feeds the fire.
                     DUCARD (CONT’D)
           You have strength born of years of
                   grief and anger, Wayne. The
            strength of a man denied revenge.
            Even in his shivering, Wayne REACTS to this.
                   DUCARD (CONT’D)
                        Why, Wayne..?
