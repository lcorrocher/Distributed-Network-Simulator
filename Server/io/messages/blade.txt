        FADE IN:

        EXT. HADES - DUSK

        We are MOVING TOWARD the Tyrell Corporation across a
        vast plain of industrialization, menacing shapes on the
        horizon, stacks belching flames five hundred feet into
        the sky the color of cigar ash.  The CAMERA MOVES INTO
        a window in the large pyramid-shaped building.  A man
        is sitting at a table.  Another man enters the room and
        sits down.  The following scene is reflected in the eye
        until HOLDEN is seated.


        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION INTERROGATION ROOM - DUSK

        The eye is magnified and deeply revealed.  Flecks of
        green and yellow in a field of milky blue.  Icy fila-
        ments surround the undulating center.

        The eye is brown in a tiny screen.  On the metallic
        surface below, the words VOIGHT-KAMPFF are finely
        etched.  There's a touch-light panel across the top
        and on the side of the screen, a dial that registers
        fluctuation of the iris.

        The instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits
        on a table between two men.  The man talking is big,
        looks like an overstuffed kid.  LEON it says on his
        breast pocket.  He's dressed in a warehouseman's uni-
        form and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in his
        lap.  Despite the obvious heat, he looks very cool.

        The man facing him is lean, hollow-cheeked, and dressed
        in grey.  Detached and efficient, he looks like a cop
        or an accountant.  His name is Holden and he's all
        business, except for the sweat on his face.

        The room is large and humid.  Rows of salvaged junk
        are stacked neatly against the walls.  Two large FANS
        WHIRR above their heads.

                                LEON
                  Okay if I talk?

        Holden doesn't answer.  He's centering Leon's eye on
        the machine.

                                LEON
                  I kinda get nervous when I take
                  tests.

                                HOLDEN
                  Don't move.

                                LEON
                  Sorry.

        He tries not to move, but finally his lips can't help
        a sheepish smile.

                                LEON
                  I already had I.Q. test this year...
                  but I don't think I never had a...

                                HOLDEN
                  Reaction time is a factor in this so
                  please pay attention. Answer as quickly
                  as you can.

                                LEON
                  Uh... sure...

                                HOLDEN
                  One one eight seven at Hunterwasser...

                                LEON
                  Oh... that's the hotel.

                                HOLDEN
                  What?

                                LEON
                  Where I live.

                                HOLDEN
                  Nice place ?

                                LEON
                  Huh? Sure.  Yeah. I guess. Is
                  that.. part of the test ?

       Holden smiles a patronising smile.

                                HOLDEN
                  Warming you up, that's all.

                                LEON
                  Oh.
                  It's

                                HOLDEN
                  You're in a desert, walking along
                  in the sand when....

                                LEON
                  Is this the test now ?

                                HOLDEN
                  Yes.   You're in a desert, walking
                  along in the sand when all of a sudden
                  you lookdown and see a.....

                                LEON
                  What one ?

   It was a timid interruption, hardly audible.

                                HOLDEN
                  What ?

                                LEON
                  What desert ?

                                HOLDEN
                  Doesn't make any difference what
                  desert.. it's completely hypothetical.

                                LEON
                  But how come I'd be there?

                                HOLDEN
                  Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want
                  to be by yourself.. who knows.
                  So you look down and see a
                  tortoise.  It's crawling toward
                  you....

                                LEON
                  A tortoise.  What's that?

                                HOLDEN
                  Know what a turtle is?

                                LEON
                  Of course.

                                HOLDEN
                  Same thing.

                                LEON
                  I never seen a turtle.

        He sees Holden's patience is wearing thin.

                                LEON
                  But I understand what you mean.

                                HOLDEN
                  You reach down and flip the
                  tortoise over on its back, Leon.

        Keeping an eye on his subject, Holden notes the dials
        in the Voight-Kampff.  One of the needles quivers
        slightly.

                                LEON
                  You make these questions, Mr.
                  Holden, or they write 'em down
                  for you?

        Disregarding the question, Holden continues, picking
        up the pace.

                                HOLDEN
                  The tortoise lays on its back,
                  its belly baking in the hot sun,
                  beating its legs trying to turn
                  itself over.  But it can't.  Not
                  without your help.  But you're not
                  helping.

        Leon's upper lip is quivering.

                                LEON
                  Whatya mean, I'm not helping?

                                HOLDEN
                  I mean you're not helping!  Why is
                  that, Leon?

        Holden looks hard at Leon, piercing look.

        Leon is flushed with anger, breathing hard, it's a
        bad moment, he might erupt.

        Suddenly Holden grins disarmingly.

                                HOLDEN
                  They're just questions, Leon.
                  In answer to your query, they're
                  written down for me.  It's a
                  test, designed to provoke an
                  emotional response.

        Leon is glaring now, the blush subsides, his anger
        slightly defused.

        Holden smiles cheerfully, very smooth.

                                HOLDEN
                  Shall we continue?

        Leon nods, still frowning, suspiciously.

                                HOLDEN
                  Describe in single words.  Only
                  the good things that come into
                  your mind.  About your mother.

                                LEON
                  My...

        Leon looks shocked, surprised.  But the needles in
        the computer barely move.  Holden goes for the in-
        side of his coat.  But big Leon is faster.  His
        laser burns a hole the size of a nickel through
        Holden's stomach.  Unlike a bullet, a laser causes
        no impact.  It goes through Holden's shoulder and
        comes out his back, clean as a whistle.  Like a
        rag doll he falls back into the seat.  Big slow Leon
        is already walking away, but he stops, turns, and
        with a little smile of satisfaction fires through
        the back of the seat.

        As Leon walks out of the room the Voight-Kampff
        begins to blink, faint but steady.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. OVERHEAD VIEW CITY - NIGHT

        We are looking down on a city of the future where
        gigantic buildings dwarf the ancient skyscrapers --
        of -- now as a huge blimp, flashing lights and
        BLARING SOUND drifts slowly over the tall buildings.

        EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

        Lights from the blimp flash along the street and wipe
        across the crowds of pedestrians as the VOICE TRACK
        CONTINUES TO BLARE from above.

        A portable noodle bar is crowded with customers, sit-
        ting on stools slurping their food out of bowls.

        DECKARD is standing near the noodle bar waiting for a
        seat.  He's in his thirties, wiry, athletic, rumpled,
        used, unshaven.  He's holding a newspaper, made of
        tissue paper, open while he glances at the blimp
        passing NOISILY overhead.  Then he notices the
        COUNTERMAN.

        The Counterman is beckoning to him to a newly vacated
        seat.

        Deckard sits down at the noodle bar and the Counterman,
        an elderly Japanese, slaps a menu in front of him.

        No words on the menu, just pictures of sliced fish
        parts.

        Deckard points to a particular item and holds up four
        fingers.

        The Counterman looks at the item on the menu, confirms
        the order by holding up two fingers.

        Deckard shakes his head "no" and repeats his four
        fingers.

        The Counterman nods, corrected and hurries off.

        Deckard glances overhead.

        The blimp drifts off among the buildings like a fish
        disappearing in seaweed, the NOISY VOICE doing a
        diminuendo.

        Whap.  The Counterman slaps a bowl of rice and a pot
        of tea in front of Deckard.  Then he puts the little
        bowl with the two slices of fish on the counter.

        Deckard looks at the fish.  Two slices of fish.

        He looks at the Counterman and holds up four fingers.

        The Counterman looks down at the two slices of fish,
        looks like two to him.  He looks at Deckard as though
        Deckard was a fool and holds up two fingers.  He can
        count!

        Deckard stares bleakly at the fish.  Can't win.

        He starts to eat and that's when he feels a tap on his
        shoulder.  He glances over his right shoulder.

        A huge cop in uniform is looming behind him.

        Deckard feels funny, looks left.

        Another cop is looming over his left shoulder.

        Deckard is tapped again from the right.

        Turning again he realizes that it isn't the cop tapping
        him, it's the short Japanese guy next to the cop.  The
        guy's got beady eyes and lots of energy.  His name is
        GAFF.

                                GAFF
                         (in Japanese)
                  *** You will be required to
                  accompany me, sir. ***

        Deckard doesn't understand Japanese, thinks the man
        wants a seat.

                                DECKARD
                  Wait your turn, pal.

        Deckard turns back to his food.

                                GAFF
                         (in Japanese)
                  *** If you do not comply with an
                  official request, I will be
                  obliged to exert my authority. ***

        Deckard is ignoring Gaff but the Counterman leans in
        Deckard's face and translates.

                                THE COUNTERMAN
                  He say, you go with him.

        Deckard turns and finds Gaff waving a badge in his face.
